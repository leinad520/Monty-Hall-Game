# Monty-Hall-Game
Made with Python

Monty Hall Game, where you pick from one of three doors to get the prize.

There is a second py file here that simulates the game 10,000 times to prove by brute force that it is better to "switch" doors when given the option.

Simulation should win 2/3 of the time, or ~6660 / 10,000 times, by switching.
